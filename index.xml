      <description>About MetalBlueberry 
I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate developer moving toward the specialization in IoT technologies.
I feel comfortable working with Python and Go as most of my recent development time has been invested with those two languages but I have experience with other popular languages such as C/C++, C# and Java.
I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for new challenges and constantly learning new things.
Technical background I&amp;rsquo;ve experience with several technologies from the IoT world from the sensors to the cloud infrastructure.</description>

      <description>About MetalBlueberry I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer since I discovered that things could be automated.
Attention
You are about to read my life since I remember it, focused on how I became a professional developer.  The beginning I started with Win-logo in the school by drawing some figures with simple functions. I still remember what could be one of the firsts function I&amp;rsquo;ve ever wrote. tits(size) The objective is clear, draw two tangent circles of a desired size.</description>
