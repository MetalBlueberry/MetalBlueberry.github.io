You are about to read my life since I remember it, focused on how I became a professional developer.


</div>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
<p>I started with <a href="http://www.win-logo.de/wl_start_e.php"target="_blank">Win-logo</a> in the school by drawing some figures with simple functions. I still remember what could be one of the firsts function I&rsquo;ve ever wrote. <code>tits(size)</code> The objective is clear, draw two tangent circles of a desired size. It was much easier to use my new fancy function than typing two times the circle command and for something that I did not understand, there was a weird pleasure in doing it. More or less at the same time, I discovered the same feeling of satisfaction when building cranes and cars with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=knex&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTqG7SUNDbWCKHx4lGehFRbie5Rjw:1571494810732&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE3davwqjlAhXxA2MBHXXyBykQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=952&amp;bih=934"target="_blank">K&rsquo;NEX</a>, but I&rsquo;ve never been a handyman. Yet another thing that was marbles circuits, the bigger and complex, the better. Just drop a marble on the top and wait to see come out at the end.</p>
<div class="admonition quote"><p class="admonition-title">quote</p>
  
 At that moment it wasn't clear, but with the time I've realized that the satisfaction comes from automation.

</div>
<p>I started building small automation circuits based on relays that simulated simple things like traffic lights and a sliding door. Thanks to my teacher at that time, I decided to go in the &ldquo;Technology&rdquo; direction. Things became interesting when my grades at high school were between 7-10 in Math, Technology and Informatics, but around 0-3 for all the others. You know that being young is hard and as Rick said <code>The teenage mind is it's own worst enemy. -Rick Sanchez</code>. After finding myself, loosing the academic year and understanding that failing to pass the high school was not an option, I started extra classes at the beginning of the next year to ensure that I didn&rsquo;t fail again. After the first 3 months, everything was working just fine and I realized that most of the time in the extra classes was wasted by talking with companions so I deiced to quit. The conversation with the teacher was something like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to leave the School?</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m just going to take it seriously and I will let you know when I pass everything.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I did it. It was harder than I expected due to the blackout of the previous year, but I did it.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-path">Choosing the path</h2>
<p>When entering the university I had 3 undergraduate degrees in my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game design</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Industrial Electronics and Automation</li>
</ul>
<p>I discarded Game design because I had to leave my city and between Computer Science and Electronics I choose the undergraduate degree called &ldquo;Industrial Electronics and Automation&rdquo;. because of the Automation word. I&rsquo;m not going to say that it was a mistake, just not what I expected. I spend the first two years learning basic stuff (Calculus, Algebra, Economics, Electronic circuits&hellip;) But there was very little content related to &ldquo;Automation&rdquo; in those subjects. I saw an icon in the desktop from my Electronics teacher that looked like the infinity sign and said &ldquo;Arduino&rdquo;. I Google it. I BOUGHT IT! best choice ever made. My grades got worst after this point in time and this is the principal reason why I didn&rsquo;t finish in 4 years. But it was worth. I learned so much on my own that when I started &ldquo;Microcontroller programming&rdquo; in 3rd year, it was a piece of cake.</p>

Me playing with Arduino with the university notes bellow.

</div>


</div>
<p>I joined to the association called &ldquo;ABI2&rdquo; in which most of the people were from the Computer Science branch and I participated in a series of events showing my abilities programming Arduino with every gadget I could find. I still have few boxes with every single Arduino sensor I could afford. After exhausting my financial possibilities and getting tired of waiting for Ebay deliveries I started to participate in a few Game Programming contest with people from ABI2 and I found that in games I could do the same I could do with an Arduino, but faster!. Ok, not the same, but i could simulate things and move faster.</p>
<p>I tried to create a team of developers to create a game but It was really hard to find people that wanted to invest more than one weekend or with the same tastes for the kind of game. I wanted a tower defense, for automation, you know. So I learned a little bit of the last skill that I needed for indie game development with Unity. 3D design with blender! and I enjoyed it a LOT. but not the way I expected. Creating skeletons and animating them was funny but creating hyper realistic renders was really fun. So I invested a considerable amount of time mastering Blender just for fun. I have a few renders uploaded to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/peRRez/images/"target="_blank">my Steam profile</a>. I didn&rsquo;t forget about the game design. here is the prof</p>

</div>

<p>During all this time, I discovered that the best way to motivate myself to learn something new is to teach other people after learning it. I did a lot of training courses with Arduino, Unity and Blender. I feel a little bit awkward about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1u-ZrK-rLs"target="_blank">the promotional video</a> for one of the blender training. But it is good to see that I&rsquo;m improving over the time.</p>
<h2 id="the-intern">The intern</h2>
<p>I started to work for a small company that was looking for someone who knew Arduino and C#. Well I had the Arduino experience with some Unity background. The company developed Scape Rooms with a lot of automation, so my task was to program the Arduinos that will be controlling the game and a software in C# that will control the game itself. It took me half year to get it to work with all the requirements and another few months to stabilize it so it won&rsquo;t stop working randomly. I did everything from the PCB design to the UI myself and I used a different technology for each part of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Altium - For PCB design</li>
<li>C - For Aruino programming</li>
<li>QT C/C++ - For network communication</li>
<li>QT QML - For player interactive UI</li>
<li>C# WPF - For Game Master control system</li>
<li>Lua + C# integration - For game logic customization without recompiling C#</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was really fun and being the only one in the team gave me a lot of freedom. The biggest problem with the job was that after a year, I felt stuck because I couldn&rsquo;t learn anything from anyone. I received an offer to work for ERNI in Barcelona and I accepted.</p>
<h2 id="first-real-job">First real job</h2>
<p>I consider the job at ERNI my first real job. I was hired because I knew C# and C/C++ with the promise that I will be developing firmware for HP Large Format Printers. The first project was defined as <code>program a sensor board with accelerometer, giroscope, magnetometer, temperature and light sensor to track the delivery of the printers</code> but it turn to be just the configuration of the board. It was already programmed with a &ldquo;Cool and simple&rdquo; interface that didn&rsquo;t work no mater how you configure it. It was not that hard, it was just impossible to make it work without modifying the firmware and that was not my task. Next project was to <code>extend the functionality to this program in C# to get the configuration from a remote server</code> and so I did. All this was for a bigger data analytics project and the next tasks can be grouped in the following groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to structure logs.</li>
<li>Troubleshooting with some data.</li>
<li>Define functional requirements.</li>
<li>Provide support to teams that consume data.</li>
</ul>
<p>This variety of tasks helped me to grow in previously unknown fields for me. English skill was a must because the requirements were sent to Shanghai for development. Understanding and define things involved a lot of communication with different teams of different profiles from Marketing to Firmware Developers.</p>
<p>Automating things was still in my point of view and I learned to use Python to use it in my everyday work. Mainly for data analysis and data reporting. I developed a simple pipeline to process logs automatically and a sample Dashboard application but it never reached production environment. We had a lot of problems with system performance and this lead me to investigate how to improve our current solution. If you investigate how to store data efficiently for data analytics you will find parquet format as a really good option for easily partitioned data. I suggested to move our system to this format to reduce the cost to query a database and improve performance but it was never accepted. I also proposed a better structure for file storage based on my learnings of what the users needed but it got rejected again. I was frustrated and feeling like I was in a ship that sinking and anyone was doing anything to prevent it.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a chance to move to a project inside HP that offered me the chance to be a developer in a cloud environment and I accepted. This is where I&rsquo;m right now</p>
